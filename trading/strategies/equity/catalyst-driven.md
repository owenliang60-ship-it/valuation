## Overview

Trade specific, identifiable catalysts with defined timelines. Unlike compounders (which are about business quality over decades), catalyst trades are about event timing: you know what should happen, approximately when, and what the stock is worth if it does. The edge is variant perception -- seeing a catalyst the market is underweighting or mispricing.

This strategy maps to the Event-Driven lens from the six investment philosophies.

## Entry Criteria

### Required Conditions
- [ ] Specific catalyst identified with approximate timeline
- [ ] Catalyst is observable (you will know when it happens or fails)
- [ ] Expected IRR >= 15% if catalyst plays out
- [ ] Market is underpricing the catalyst (variant view documented)
- [ ] Downside scenario defined: what happens if catalyst fails or delays

### Catalyst Types
- **Earnings inflection**: accelerating growth not in consensus estimates
- **Product launch**: major new product/service with quantifiable revenue impact
- **Regulatory decision**: approval/clearance with binary outcome
- **Corporate action**: spinoff, buyback, management change
- **Sector rotation**: macro shift favoring the sector
- **Valuation re-rating**: multiple expansion as business mix shifts

### OPRMS Requirements
- **Minimum DNA Rating**: B (catalyst can compensate for lower quality)
- **Minimum Timing Rating**: B (catalyst should create its own timing)
- **Preferred Conditions**: DNA A + Timing A (high conviction, confirmed trend)

### Pre-Entry Checklist
- [ ] Catalyst timeline documented (specific quarter/month, not "sometime")
- [ ] IRR calculation shows >= 15% return at target price
- [ ] Kill conditions tied to catalyst milestones
- [ ] Not within 5 trading days of earnings (unless earnings IS the catalyst)
- [ ] Downside scenario quantified

## Sizing Rules

- **Initial Position**: 25-50% of target position
- **Scaling Plan**: 2-3 tranches
  - Initial: on thesis completion
  - Add: on early catalyst confirmation (e.g., channel checks, preliminary data)
  - Full size: when catalyst timing becomes clearer
- **Max Position**: DNA_cap x Timing_coeff
  - DNA B stocks capped at 7% even with Timing S
  - DNA A stocks can reach 15% with Timing A
- **Sizing Formula**: `Position = Total Capital x DNA_cap x Timing_coeff`
  - Size inversely proportional to catalyst uncertainty. More certain catalyst = larger position.

## Exit Protocol

### Profit Taking
- **Catalyst realized**: Take 50-75% of position within 1-5 days of catalyst event. Hold remainder only if new thesis emerges.
- **Pre-catalyst run-up**: If stock reaches target price before catalyst, take 30-50% off. Risk/reward compressed.
- **Time decay**: If catalyst is delayed beyond original timeline by >3 months, reassess. Reduce by 50% unless new evidence supports extended hold.

### Stop Loss
- **Hard stop**: -15% from average entry. Catalyst trades have defined timelines -- if the stock is falling significantly before the catalyst, the market may know something you don't.
- **Soft stop**: review at -10% to confirm thesis is intact.

### Thesis Invalidation
- Catalyst definitively cancelled or materially delayed (>6 months)
- Competing catalyst negates the thesis (e.g., competitor launches first)
- Fundamental deterioration makes catalyst irrelevant even if it occurs
- Evidence emerges that the market was right and your variant view was wrong

## Risk Controls

- **Max loss per trade**: 15% of entry cost (hard stop)
- **Earnings protocol**: If earnings are NOT the catalyst, reduce position by 30% ahead of earnings to avoid unrelated volatility. If earnings ARE the catalyst, maintain full position.
- **Correlation check**: No more than 3 catalyst trades with the same catalyst type (e.g., don't have 3 regulatory approval plays simultaneously).
- **Max concurrent positions**: 5-7 catalyst trades at a time. Each is time-bounded, so portfolio naturally rotates.
- **Timeline discipline**: Every catalyst trade has a "give up" date. If the catalyst hasn't materialized by this date, exit regardless.
