# Post-Trade Review Framework

Complete methodology for reviewing closed trades. Every closed position gets a review within 48 hours. The goal is not to judge the outcome (P&L) but to judge the process (was the decision-making sound?).

**A winning trade with bad process is a warning. A losing trade with good process is acceptable.**

## Section 2: Thesis Accuracy Assessment

Was the investment thesis correct?

### Thesis Restatement
> [Copy the original falsifiable thesis from the journal entry]

### Assessment
- **Verdict**: Validated / Partially Validated / Invalidated
- **What happened**: [Factual account of what occurred vs. what was expected]
- **Variant view accuracy**: [Was the market actually wrong where you thought it was?]
- **Timeline accuracy**: [Did events unfold on the expected timeline?]

### Scoring
| Dimension | Score (1-10) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Thesis correctness | | Was the core thesis right? |
| Timing accuracy | | Did events happen when expected? |
| Sizing appropriateness | | Was the position size right for the conviction level? |
| Execution quality | | Entry/exit timing and slippage |
| **Overall process score** | | Average of above |

**Outcome-adjusted note**: A high process score with a losing trade is FINE. A low process score with a winning trade is a WARNING.

## Section 3: Three Analytical Tensions

Every trade involves internal debates. Surfacing and documenting these tensions is the most valuable part of the review. Identify the 3 most significant tensions.

### Tension 1: [Frame as a question]

**Case For**: [Strongest argument + evidence supporting one side]

**Case Against**: [Strongest counter-argument + evidence]

**What Tipped the Scales**: [What ultimately decided the debate?]

**In Hindsight**: [Was the resolution correct? What would you weight differently?]

### Tension 2: [Frame as a question]

**Case For**:

**Case Against**:

**What Tipped the Scales**:

**In Hindsight**:

### Tension 3: [Frame as a question]

**Case For**:

**Case Against**:

**What Tipped the Scales**:

**In Hindsight**:

## Section 4: Observable Milestones

What were the observable milestones from the pre-trade thesis, and what happened to each?

| Milestone | Expected Timeline | Actual Outcome | Status |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|--------|
| | | | Hit / Missed / Pending / Never Tested |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Kill Conditions Review
| Kill Condition | Triggered? | Notes |
|----------------|-----------|-------|
| | Yes / No | |
| | | |

**Were the kill conditions well-designed?** [Did they catch the right risks? Were any missing?]

## Section 5: Execution Quality

### Entry Assessment
- **Planned entry**: $___
- **Actual entry**: $___
- **Slippage**: ___ bps
- **Entry timing**: Too early / On time / Too late / Good
- **Tranche execution**: [Did scaling in work as planned?]

### Exit Assessment
- **Planned exit trigger**: [What was supposed to trigger the exit?]
- **Actual exit trigger**: [What actually triggered the exit?]
- **Exit timing**: Too early / On time / Too late / Good
- **Emotional influence**: None / Some / Significant
  - [If any emotional influence, describe: fear, greed, FOMO, regret aversion]

### Position Sizing Assessment
- **Planned position**: ___% of portfolio
- **Actual position**: ___% of portfolio
- **Was sizing appropriate for conviction level?** Yes / No
- **In hindsight, would you size differently?** [How and why?]

## Section 6: Lessons Extracted

Categorize lessons by where they should feed back.

### Strategy-Level Lessons
- [Should any entry/exit rules in the strategy doc be updated?]
- [Did the strategy perform as expected?]

### Risk-Level Lessons
- [New kill condition patterns discovered?]
- [Position sizing adjustments needed?]
- [New risk rules to propose?]

### Knowledge-Level Lessons
- [Should the OPRMS DNA or Timing rating be adjusted?]
- [New insights about the company, sector, or market?]
- [Investment philosophy refinements?]

### Personal Lessons
- [What would you do differently?]
- [What behavioral patterns appeared? (overconfidence, loss aversion, etc.)]
- [What worked well that should be repeated?]

## Section 7: Feedback Actions

Specific, actionable items to update other desk systems.

| Action | Target | Priority | Status |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| [e.g., "Add earnings-bridge protocol to compounder strategy"] | Strategy Library | High | Pending |
| [e.g., "Update AAPL DNA rating from S to A"] | Knowledge Base | Medium | Pending |

## Cognitive Bias Check

Before finalizing, check for these common biases:

- [ ] **Hindsight bias**: Am I judging decisions with information I didn't have at the time?
- [ ] **Outcome bias**: Am I letting the P&L color my assessment of the process?
- [ ] **Confirmation bias**: Am I selectively remembering evidence that supports my view?
- [ ] **Recency bias**: Am I overweighting the most recent events?
- [ ] **Self-serving bias**: Am I taking credit for wins and blaming external factors for losses?
