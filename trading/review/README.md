# Post-Trade Review

Systematic framework for extracting lessons from every closed trade. The review process is what turns individual trades into institutional knowledge. Without reviews, the same mistakes repeat.

## Purpose

1. **Assess thesis accuracy** -- was the investment thesis correct, partially correct, or wrong?
2. **Surface analytical tensions** -- what were the key debates, and how were they resolved?
3. **Track milestones** -- which observable milestones were hit, missed, or never tested?
4. **Extract lessons** -- what should change in strategies, risk rules, or knowledge base?
5. **Close the loop** -- feed lessons back to Knowledge Base and Strategy Library

## Review Cadence

- **Every closed trade**: review within 48 hours of position close
- **Monthly rollup**: aggregate lessons from all trades closed that month
- **Quarterly deep-dive**: patterns across all reviews, strategy effectiveness analysis
