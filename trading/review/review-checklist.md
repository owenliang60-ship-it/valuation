Quick-reference checklist for every closed trade. Complete within 48 hours of position close.

## Mandatory Items

- [ ] Trade summary completed (P&L, hold period, position size)
- [ ] Original thesis restated from journal entry
- [ ] Thesis accuracy verdict assigned (validated / partially / invalidated)
- [ ] 3 analytical tensions identified and analyzed
- [ ] Observable milestones tracked (hit / missed / never tested)
- [ ] Kill conditions reviewed (triggered? well-designed?)
- [ ] Execution quality assessed (entry timing, slippage, sizing)
- [ ] At least 1 lesson extracted per category (strategy, risk, knowledge, personal)
- [ ] Feedback actions listed with target desk and priority
- [ ] Cognitive bias checklist completed

## Optional but Recommended

- [ ] Process score calculated (1-10)
- [ ] Emotional influence documented honestly
- [ ] Comparison to alternative actions (what if you had sized differently, exited earlier/later)
- [ ] Strategy doc updated with new lesson (if applicable)

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Judging by outcome, not process
A trade that made money on luck is not a good trade. A trade that lost money despite sound analysis is not necessarily a bad trade. Score the process, not the P&L.

### 2. Vague lessons
Bad: "I should have sold earlier."
Good: "The stock reached my PMARP > 95% profit-taking signal on day 12, but I held because I expected more. Adding a rule: when PMARP profit signal triggers, take at least 30% off regardless of further expectations."

### 3. Missing the real lesson
The obvious lesson is often not the important one. Look deeper:
- If you exited too early, why? Was it fear? Was your target wrong? Were you following the rules?
- If you sized too small, why? Did you lack conviction? Was the evidence insufficient? Was OPRMS correctly applied?

### 4. Skipping tensions
If you can't identify 3 tensions, you probably aren't thinking hard enough. Every trade involves trade-offs. Common tensions:
- Valuation vs. momentum (cheap but falling, or expensive but rising)
- Concentration vs. diversification (add to winner vs. spread risk)
- Patience vs. opportunity cost (hold for thesis vs. redeploy capital)
- Fundamental vs. technical signals (thesis intact but chart broken)

### 5. Not closing the feedback loop
A lesson without an action item is just a thought. Every review should produce at least one specific action:
- Update a strategy document
- Propose a new risk rule
- Adjust an OPRMS rating
- Add a note to the Knowledge Base

## Review Quality Self-Assessment

After completing the review, rate yourself:

| Criteria | Yes / No |
|----------|----------|
| Would a stranger understand this trade from the review alone? | |
| Are all 3 tensions genuinely substantive (not trivial)? | |
| Do feedback actions have specific owners and deadlines? | |
| Did I honestly assess emotional influence? | |
| Did I check all 5 cognitive biases? | |

If any answer is "No", go back and improve that section before filing.
