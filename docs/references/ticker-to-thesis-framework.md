## Core Architecture

6 specialized AI analysts debate through 5 iterative rounds, moderated by a Research Director,
to produce institutional-quality investment memos.

## Six Investment Philosophies (Analyst Lenses)

| # | Lens | Philosophy | Core Metric | Horizon |
|---|------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | Quality Compounder | Durable moats, 20+ year holds | ROIC | Permanent |
| 2 | Imaginative Growth | TAM vision, disruptive potential | Revenue Growth | 5+ years |
| 3 | Fundamental L/S | Tiger Cub hedging approach | EV/EBITDA | 1-3 years |
| 4 | Deep Value | Margin of safety, contrarian | Replacement Cost | Variable |
| 5 | Event-Driven | Corporate actions, catalysts | Catalyst Timeline | 6-18 months |
| 6 | Macro-Tactical | Fed policy, liquidity regimes | Macro Alignment | Regime-dependent |

## Debate Protocol

### Iteration 1-2 (Discovery)
- Broad exploration, identify key forces
- Each analyst presents thesis from their philosophy

### Iteration 3-5 (Enrichment)
- Deepen evidence, resolve tensions
- Avoid re-litigating settled debates
- Quote exact critiques, state Accept/Reject/Partially Accept
- Acknowledge what was wrong, provide new evidence

## Four Investment Buckets

| Bucket | Description | Horizon |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Long-term Compounder | Quality businesses with durable advantages | 3+ years |
| Catalyst-Driven Long | Event-driven, specific catalysts identified | 6-18 months |
| Short Position | Overvaluation with defined risk | Variable |
| Secular Short | Structural decline | 3-5+ years |

## Financial Hurdles

- **LONG positions**: >= 15% expected IRR
- **SHORT positions**: >= 20-25% expected IRR
- **PASS**: If returns don't clear thresholds despite qualitative merit

## Memo Quality Rubric

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Thesis Clarity | 25% | Falsifiable thesis, explicit key forces, variant view |
| Evidence Quality | 25% | 3+ primary sources, 8-10+ total, fact-checked |
| Valuation Rigor | 20% | Multiple methods, sensitivity tables, IRR calc |
| Risk Framework | 15% | Kill conditions, position sizing rationale, downside scenarios |
| Decision Readiness | 15% | Action price, entry/exit rules, observable milestones |

**Target score: > 7.0/10**

## Evidence Hierarchy

### Primary Sources (3+ required)
- **Direct voice**: CEO interviews, earnings calls, conference presentations
- **Stakeholder signals**: Glassdoor reviews, customer feedback, supplier commentary
- **Behavioral data**: Patent filings, job postings, insider trading activity

### Total Sources: 8-10+
- Fact-checking before synthesis
- Primary over secondary evidence

## Kill Conditions (Required per Memo)

Every investment thesis must specify conditions under which it is invalidated:
- Observable, measurable triggers (not calendar dates)
- Specific thresholds (e.g., "if gross margin drops below 60% for 2 consecutive quarters")
- Information triggers for immediate position review

## Key Analytical Tensions (3 per Memo)

Each memo must surface and resolve 3 substantive debates:
1. **The tension** (framed as a question)
2. **Case for** (strongest argument + evidence)
3. **Case against** (strongest counter-argument)
4. **Resolution** (what tipped the scales)

## Writing Standards

- 80%+ active voice
- One idea per paragraph
- Topic sentences first
- Eliminate hedges on beliefs
- No throat-clearing openings
- 12,000-20,000 characters of substantive analysis

## Cost Reference

- ~$13-15 per full analysis (Claude Sonnet, ~1.7M tokens)
- 77 stocks full coverage ~ $1,000
- On-demand per-stock analysis is more practical
